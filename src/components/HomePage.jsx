        <p>
          Kraftwerk is a German band formed in Düsseldorf in 1970 by Ralf Hütter
          and Florian Schneider. Widely considered as innovators and pioneers of
          electronic music, they were among the first successful acts to

        <h6>This Heat</h6>
        <p>
          This Heat were an English experimental rock band, formed in early 1976
          in Camberwell, London by multi-instrumentalists Charles Bullen,
          Charles Hayward, and Gareth Williams. Originally active from 1976
          until 1982, This Heat were active in the ascendancy of British punk
          rock and post-punk, but stood apart from those scenes due to an
          experimental, confrontational, and politically charged approach. This
          Heat's commercial success was limited, and their discography consisted
          of only two albums and a EP, but in later years the band have been
          widely considered a link between early 1970s music styles such as
          krautrock and later experimental genres such as industrial music and
          post-rock.
